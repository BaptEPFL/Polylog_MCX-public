# Polylog_MCX-public

This repository contains the code and data used in the paper "Polylogarithmic-depth controlled-NOT gates without ancilla qubits" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13206).

In particular, it contains:
- a Notebook reproducing all the data presented in the paper, entitled paper_data.ipynb,
- a Notebook turning the data into figures, entitled paper_plot.ipynb,
- a Notebook explaning how to compile the novel multi-controlled NOT gates, tutorial.ipynb,
- a test file construction_test.py (to run from the terminal with the command 'pytest construction_test.py').
